# Virtual Environments

I believe that Janet Murray's predictions were spot on. What she describes with the example of what an episode of *ER* could be like is exactly what every open world videogame is like nowadays. THere's an environment that you're in, which has people and buildings, and in those buildings are halways that you can walk into, which have rooms that you can go into. Every one of the steps has things that you can interact with. Even your character has a cell phone that texts will pop up on the screen so you are completely immersed and feel as if you are actually in the game.

Murray states that the environment should tell a story for the viewers, in three dimensions. The Mandalorian does exactly that with its virtual environments. The settings can be anywhere from a futuristic saloon, to a desolate, dry, barren land with nothing but stone and sand. In the saloon steps would be taken from seeing all of the people there, to the design of the building itself to the sound design. There isn't a point in this show where you are thinking in the back of your head that "it's a show", like you would during a play or musical. The level of immersement in today's entertainment is unrivaled.
