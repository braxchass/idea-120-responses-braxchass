## Project 5 Proposal

I have created numerous portfilios over the years and what I've gathered is that an employer who is looking to hire a designer has seen dozens of portfolios with similar layouts. As a designer, we should be focusing on making our presentation stand out, and not just the workitself. Sort of like a book. The cover isn't what you're selling, but it is meant to make someone want to open it And see what's inside. I plan to make my portfolio somewhat interactive and generate intrigue so at the end of the day after looking at a few dozen of them, mine stays somewhere at the top of that person's brain. I want to create something that makes them feel refreshed that they stumbled onto mine and not exhausting, scorlling through something they tell themselves they've seen a hundred times over. The work I would put in my portfolio would be my graphic and industrial design work as well as my manufacturing and photopgraphy work. A few projects I've completed in school, as some of them would carry enough weight to be placed into a professional portfolio.
