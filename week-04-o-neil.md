# WMD, Friend or Foe?

WMD’s are weapons of math destruction, a clever play on a similar acronym, but these WMD’s refer to how numbers, formulas and just math in general can be used as weapons. The D.C. mayor in 2007 planned to rehabilitate underperforming schools in the area where the dropout rate was close to 50%. They formulated a hypothesis that the teachers were underperforming, so in turn, the students were as well. Logically, they wanted to weed out the bad ones and keep the good ones and that would fix the problem, right? A teacher argued against the method of evaluation, believing that it was unfair. The idea was removing human bias would be beneficial but learning and teaching is 100% human and these results were truly unfounded in the end. People are always going through life and you can’t put all of that on the teacher. The model did not include nearly enough variables. WMD’s will hurt those who are on the fringe and not just the large pool.

WMD feedback loops give information back to the inquirer, which takes an entire situation or in the case of a job search, someone’s life,  and minimizes it into a yes or a no. Employers are using credit score information as WMD’s which lets them filter people out who they deem less reliable, but doesn’t take into account that someone could be more reliable than someone with a higher credit score based on who they are, and not just what a number says. In this case, the WMD punishes the poor; the people who might need that job the most. 

Since WMD’s are not human, one cannot appeal to it emotionally, as a human being, which further contributes to their moniker. They are used as if they are the be-all and end-all, meant to provide uniquely reliable results when they do the exact opposite. They may provide insight but they do not account for enough variables or human factors to be used in scenarios that significantly impact the well-being of people as a whole.
