## Project 4 Proposal

The story-based game I would like to create would be reminiscent of some of the first few computer games that came out. I want it to take the player back to a time where suspense could easily be generated without the neccesity for strong visuals and could pull the player in like a Stepehn King novel. Something you told yourself youd play for 10 minutes but look at the corner of your screen and see that it's been 30 minutes. I am thinking of making it like a slasher film where just about all of the characters will die throughout the story but the question will be the who and the why of the situation. Keeping the player on their toes and mnaking them second-guess their decisions is something I think is key in having an entertaining game of this genre without the use of strong visual aids. If there is a way to add music I would like to compose a few loops to increase the amount of suspense felt in specific areas of the game. The game will take place in a classroom or an office space as I understand it must be on the shorter side, but its brevity won't detract from its impact.
