### Green Screen Project

For my green screen project, I plan to edit myself into entertaining, well known clips from interviews, the news, etc. offering contrary commentary, yet supplementing the original filmography. Things like interviews with Trump, old vines, etc. THe style of humor will have to be improvised based on each little video, sort of like "A Bad Lip Reading", but with more context, of course.
