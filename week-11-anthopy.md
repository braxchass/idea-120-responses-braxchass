## Anna Anthropy, Rise of Video Zinesters Questions

Three questions I asked myself during these readings are 

### 1. Is the rise of videogames tangentially attached to the increased amount of interactivity and realism?
### 2. Why would we want realism out of a game?
### 3. Does occupancy make a game better?

I will be discussing Question 1 here.

### Is the rise of videogames tangentially attached to the increased amount of interacitiivy and realism?

If we take a look at other forms of entertainment media, we might come upon books and movies, both of which are story-based. THey all have acharacvters, a setting, a plot and if they're good, they'll have a climax and resolution. The difference is that with a book, it is not visual, but it is longer. Movies were meant to be enjoyed in the amount of time you would feel like taking your family out to go to, sit down, watch and leave, comfortably. Books were meant to be digested over time (unless you ask Edgar Allen Poe) and have more impact if you know the proper way to read them.

Now if we take a look at videogames, some started off being story based, like interactive books, and others were more arcade-styled where the game was repetive to a certai extent, whether it be through recurring action(s) or through levels you would prgress through. If we look decades later into the future, the games graphics started improving and now we are looking at a time where movie and story reminiscent of a book are unified into one. Now these games were meant to be played over 30-50+ hours and would be one long, very interactive story. These games would be linear, following the path the storyboard team and developers wanted it to go. 

Today, we finally understand that the ideal videogame is a mixture of all of the different pathywas entertainment media had gone. The games that do the best will have a clear direction, but will install elements of characters, moral decisions, settings, plots, turns and twists, but also allow the player to have some control over making decisions that influence the outcome of the game, making their playthough specifically unique. It's even fiarly common for a player to be able to design their own character, making the playthrough feel even more unique to them.  With this format, we have the story, the interactivity, the realness of real-life scenarios and people, all put into a controller in hour hand with only a handful of buttons. I think the realer these games can get, the more people will be interested in playing them.
