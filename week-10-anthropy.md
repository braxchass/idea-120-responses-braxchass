## Anna Anthropy, Rise of Video Zinesters + Accessibility

Accessibility is extremely important in game design and its furtherance. If we look at any profession or research field, we would see that collaboration is what made it great. Like, but different minds puring their time into pushing something into the next stage, improving, inventing and innovating all toward one cause. If games just had a handful of executives working on them, they would get nowhere. We are in the age where anyone with enough time on their hands to learn, can create videogames. Blender is a free, open-source 3D modeling program and so many people have contributed to it to it that it rivals some of the top-tier softwares used by top game developers for 3D modeling such as Autodesk Maya/3DS Max and Cinema 4D.


The complexity of videogames has skyrocketed in the past couple decades due to the amount of delegation used whilst working on a game. Several people will 3D model props for the game, a dozen othr people will be working on character design, another dozen would work on storyboarding, etc. So instead of dividing a small team  up and stretching them to do a little of everything, different individuals are tasked to focus on a single element of the game and they will only need to worry about perfecting that area and when they're done, someone else will only need to combine what they've done with other elements of the game's creation. From this method of working, the same effort is put into everything and the game becomes a much more immersive environment.

With more people able to be involved in the creation of videogames, different ideas are able to be pushed, where they may have never been heard or even thought of. Games started off being more pixel-based and less artistic and through the help of artists and later 3D modelers, games are much more realistic. People who've studied human anatomy are now regularly hired to ensure that characters in games are identical to real people. Stuntmen are working in motion capture to ensure movements are realistic and action sequences are "real". Different methods of modeling parts have been created and proved superior to increase speed and workflow so games can be released in shorter timeframes, and so forth. These are just scratching the surface of the contributions that have been made to videogames because of how accesible the knowledge of creating them is.

Without collaboration, nothing in this world would advance. The people originally involved would plateau and their work would soon become stagnant. Car manufacuturers regulary work with other car manufacturers and together, they establish what the general look of the next 4 years for cars will be. It's not a descision made unilaterally. It's a decision made through collaboration, and in any field, it  becomes ever-expanding.
