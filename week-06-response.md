## Something is wrong on the internet

I do agree with the problems of internet in how certain things are categorized and how some search results can send you down a dark rabbit hole. I think a proper solution is making madatory categorization when videos and things are posted to filter them through the proper channels and keep them out of a "normal" search result- oh wait we already have that. You can't make someone use the proper tags and the internet can't perfectly scan and remove "innapropriate" material.

I think Bridle looks too deep into it, as most kids will get over seeing something "innapropriate" (within reason) on the internet and most of the thought people have had about what the internet "should be" have already been takely deeply into conversation. It's as if he skips over that parents are meant to be the end all of what passes through their children's eyes while at home.

Bridle's MS Paint book cover just about sums up his views.
